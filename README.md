# django_pdfParser
This is web based PDF Parser that i built to parse Financial Statement.
First i made simple python script to parse pdf but then i decided to host it on server. but how ??????????
Then i realised there is beautiful python framework named DJango to make REST API and many more things.
Then i learnt it and add this script into the view and hosted it on server then boom.... It worked.... 

# How to Use it
1) Make a simple local envirnment on your local machine for python and django and djangorestframework
2) then to start server simply type : $ python manage.py runserver
3) Using postman send financial statement pdf file (should not contain scanned copy) in form data and then watch reponse
